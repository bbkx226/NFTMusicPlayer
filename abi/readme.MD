# ABI Folder and JSON Files in Blockchain

The `abi` folder and the JSON files inside it play a crucial role in interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## ABI Folder

The `abi` (Application Binary Interface) folder typically contains the ABI of your smart contracts. The ABI is essentially a JSON representation of your smart contract, including all of its functions and variables. It is used to specify how to call functions in a contract and also describes the contract's binary layout.

### JSON Files

The `.json` files inside the `abi` folder are generated when you compile your smart contract. These files contain the ABI of the contract, the contract's bytecode, and other information about the contract.

For example, a file named `NFTMusicPlayer.json` would contain the ABI and bytecode of the `NFTMusicPlayer` contract. This file is used when you want to interact with the `NFTMusicPlayer` contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

#### -address.json Files

The `-address.json` files, such as `NFTMusicPlayer-address.json`, contain the deployed address of the contract on the Ethereum network. This address is used to interact with the deployed contract.

For example, the NFTMusicPlayer-address.json file might contain:

```json
{
  "address": "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3"
}
```

This means that the `NFTMusicPlayer` contract is deployed at the address `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3` on the Ethereum network.
