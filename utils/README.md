# Service Worker Management

Our application includes code to manage service workers, which are scripts that run in the background and enable features like offline functionality and faster load times. Here's an explanation of the relevant code:

```typescript
import { FC, useEffect } from "react";
import * as serviceWorker from "./serviceWorker";

const Home: FC = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    serviceWorker.unregister();
  }, []);

  return <div />;
};

export default Home;

export const unregister = (): void => {
  if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(registration => {
      registration.unregister();
    });
  }
};
```

## Purpose

1. Offline Functionality: Cache assets and API responses for offline use.
2. Faster Load Times: Improve app loading speed after initial visit.
3. Background Sync: Perform tasks when the app is not open.
4. Push Notifications: Enable web push notifications.

## Why Unregister?

We use `unregister()` by default, which means:

- The app won't work offline.
- It won't load from cache (potentially slower load times on repeat visits).
- It won't receive background updates.

Reasons for Unregistering:

- Simplifies development and debugging.
- Ensures users always get the latest version.
- Avoids potential caching issues during updates.
